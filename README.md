The project aims at detecting and classifying relevant objects in a video stream (Surveil-
lance Video) in real time. The project is a step forward in the era of Edge Computing, by delivering a fully functional and independent end-user device, such as the Pi. We discuss in length the progress made leading upto the current development scene and possible future enhancements that can serve as motivation for further work. We study various working models and further divulge into the chosen model with a discussion on the steps involved for the same.
